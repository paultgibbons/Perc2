reporter: And this is a military town, Judy and little by little we
are seeing these soldiers head out. In a strange way and this may
sound unusual, there's a little sense of relief because these soldiers
were set to leave in January and now they got second deployment
orders, the delay, of course, the inability to get access to Turkey,
but along the way, the 4th Infantry Division is one seeped in
tradition and there's a real sense of pride among the soldiers, 250 of
which left yesterday, over the course of the week 12,000 will be
leaving from here. Another 4,000 from Fort Carson in Colorado and it
dates back to World War I. Their equipment that left on January is now
on a ship on its way south through the Suez Canal and it's interesting
to note some of the equipment that's been held up for the last couple
of months, there are some 5 helicopters, 200 tanks as well as 150
Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles. These are highly trained soldiers.
They are ready to go. They are happy to be finally able to come and
back up the first wave of troops that left from here. Their mission is
very broad, judy to deploy anywhere in the world in support of
National Strategy. They doan know what they'll be doing. They will
learn that once they get there their first stop will be to Central
Command, they'll receive more specific orders. They will be join by
the first cavalry. They have received deployment orders. They have not
yet been told to make final arrangements. They all tell me, the
soldiers you talk to and also some of the information people here at
Fort Hood, they train like they fight. They are ready. They are
determined and they are very patriotic in support of our country. They
are going over there to do a mission they believe in and as we said,
250 left yesterday. They were armedded with their m-16s, they are
concerned. Their families were here to see them off, but they are
determined to return though it is interesting to note that many of
them, so many with young children have told their kids that mom or dad
could be away for as long as a year. Judy?
