an occasion that marked the formal
establishment between our two countries. Since then this
relationship has grown in importance to us both through
good times and bad. Both of my generation and Britain have
special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the
Russian people made to defeat fascism in the Second World
War. Nothing, not even the fact that our countries became
estranged in the war's aftermath, has ever dimmed our
memory of the scale of your loss. That experience should
continue to inspire us, as we seek to build a more peaceful
and secure world. When I visited your country in 1994, I
recall saying to President Yeltsin that he and I spent most
of our lives believing such a visit would never happen. And
that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved
wrong. I'm just as delighted now, nine years later, to be
able to welcome you here and to learn about the great
changes which have occurred in your country since I was
there. Russia has established itself as our partner and our
friend. We work together bilatarily and on the
international stage. And we are developing new links all
the time in fields of commerce, culture, counterterrorism,
energy, education environment. I know you will be seeing
evidence of some of this during your visit. Mr. President,
it is, I believe, a sign of genuine friendship that we are
able to have disagreements, but remain firm partners. It is
no secret that the significant differences between our two
countries earlier this year on how best to handle Iraq. But
we are now able to look forward together firmly in
agreement on the route we have decided in the United
Nations. Although, the tragic loss of British lives today
reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced. But as we
look ahead, we know that our long-term partnership is of
profound importance to both of us. This is clearly evident,
if we look beyond the challenges of international politics.
In the last few months alone, we have heard the
announcements of major investments in Russia by British
companies. We have also heard a different sign of Sir Paul
mccartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in Red Square. And
we, in turn, have been enthralled by the celebrations of
your own city in Petersburg. At the same time, work
continues to bring the young people of our countries closer
together through language, teaching, school exchanges and
university programs. We have a vibrant and exciting
relationship from which we both derive mass benefit. Mr.
President, your country is rich --
