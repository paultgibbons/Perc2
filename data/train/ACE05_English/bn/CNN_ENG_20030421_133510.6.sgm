American Airlines may soon have a new destination as well,
bankruptcy court. The Airlines flight attendants union is
calling for a new vote on $340 million in wage concessions
after the disclosure last year of an executive compensation
plan. The world's largest airline needs the concessions to
avoid a bankruptcy filing. Amr, the parent of American
Airlines, cancelled the Bonus Program and CEO Donald Carty
as apoll cized to employees. The share plunging 40% here at
the NYSE. The overall market a fairly quiet session. Volume
is thin as some traders take an extended holiday weekend.
Over the next couple of days we'll continue to get earnings
reports. Today only a few corporate reports and little
economic news to move the market. It's why the Dow has been
fairly range bound. The Nasdaq at this point little
changed. That is the latest from the New York Stock
Exchange. There is lots more "live from" coming up after
the break.
