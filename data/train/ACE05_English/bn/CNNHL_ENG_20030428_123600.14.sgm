an American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut are settling in at the
International Space Station. A Russian Soyuz capsule dropped them off
this morning after docking perfectly at the orbiting outpost. It was
the first manned flight to the space station since the February first
shuttle "Columbia" disaster. About 90 minutes after the docking, the
crews opened the hatch between the two spacecraft. Edward Lu and Yuri
Malenchenko of Russia will spend the next six months in the space
station. They're replacing the two astronauts and one cosmonaut
currently there. The Soyuz will carry that crew back to Earth may 4th.
