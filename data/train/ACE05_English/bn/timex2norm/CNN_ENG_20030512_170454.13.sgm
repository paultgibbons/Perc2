a national weeklong terror drill began in Seattle and an
industrial lot in the city. Straun with smashed cars, buses
and other debris representing the hypothetical damage from
a fan that sized radioactive dirty bomb. The test designed
to measure the responsiveness of emergency workers to a
terrorist attack. It's been a year and a half since a
series of anthrax attacks killed five people. No one has
ever been arrested in connection with that case and the FBI
is considering draining a Maryland pond relating to
evidence for those unsolved attacks. Kelli arena reports.

reporter: The FBI's interest in this state park in Maryland
dates back to last December. Officials got a tip back then
that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the
park's ponds. Officials say they found the tip significant
because the pond is about ten miles from Fort Dietrick
where the army experimented with anthrax. Agents searched
the area at least four times since then. The mayor says the
FBI is now considering draining one of the ponds. The
police chief dine is in regular contact with the FBI.

there are a number of facets to this investigation. It's
very, very significant. After all, it is a murder
investigation. Multiple Murder Investigation, so I'm sure

reporter: According to government sources, agents in
December found a large plastic enclosed container with
large openings on the side. Officials say there is no
evidence connecting anything found in the park to anthrax
or the anthrax attacks. Nor is there any evidence linking
any individual to the deadly anthrax ledders. The FBI has
said nothing publicly about anyone it may be investigating,
but Attorney General John Ashcroft did refer publicly to
Steven Hatfield, a former researcher as a person of
interest. He's repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and the
spokesman told CNN --

well, the FBI can drain the Pacific Ocean but they won't
find any evidence that he was involved with the attacks
because he had nothing to do with the anthrax attacks at
all.

reporter: Investigators involved this case clearly
frustrated. 18 months later, still not one single arrest
for those attacks that killed five people and sickened 13
others. Lou?

Kelly, where does this investigation on Hatfield stand? I
mean, we have rather -- I can't think of another case like
it. We've got rather public statements by law enforcement
officials saying that he is the suspect that they think
he's the Guy Athen we have denial and then we have this
stuff. It's really -- really extraordinary.

<TURN>
reporter: Well, the Attorney General has been the only
person that has even mentioned Steven Hatfield's name
publicly and he called him a person of interest. Not a
suspect. But
