Martha Stewart isn't the only corporate figurehead in the
news today. The jury has handed down a $30 million, a grand
rapids jury saying Taco Bell has to pay the true creators
of the Chihuahua Mass Cot. Two men claimed their idea
originated, and proved I am in the wrong business. TACO
ball is appealing. Joins me is Tom rinks with his attorney
John Doza. Tom, you've got to be happy with the settlement.
I know they're going to appeal, but first et tell my how
you calm up with the Chihuahua character?

Joe and myself, he's the partner, we were looking to design
some licenses to put on some t-shirts, and at the time big
dogs were big, and all the mean dogs, and no fear was a big
hit, and we thought it was time for a bit of a change for
the 18-24 crowd. So we actually took the opposite of all
that, and looked for the smallers, weakest, most timid
animal, and tried to make him cool, tried to make him big.
And we knew if he gave him some spunk, everybody would root
for him.

How did the TACO Bell folks run into you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
they actually came to us at a licensing show. We had been
licensing to a bunch of different manufacturers, and in
1996 we were at a show in New York City where Nick Loada
and Universal Studios, and Taco Bell walked up to us and
said they were looking for a mass cot for their brand and
this would be perfect. That started a year relationship we
had with them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and it went on for a year, and you thought it didn't Pan
out and then you pick up a trade paper and read they're
going ahead with it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
after we finalized all the commercials, and actually done
the campaign for them, they hired a new AD agency, and
telephone calls just started staggering off. Then they
stopped coming, and we ahead imp the ads, and they were
exactly what we had presented for over a year.
</TURN>
<TURN>
when you first heard that, or read that, did you just go
ballistic? I mean, no offense, but it was you and one other
guy who created this thing. They're a huge, huge
corporation.
</TURN>
<TURN>
yeah, it was devastating, to say the least, but we really
didn't know
