we'll continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in Florida.
Let's much on to another important story. It's happened, of course,
several times during the war in Iraq, journalists caught in the line
of fire and killed. Israeli troops are facing a similar situation with
two journalists killed in just the past two weeks. Here's CNN's cly
Wallace.

reporter: Friday night in the Gaza Strip and a journalist is about to
lose his life. Shortly after several shots are heard an Israeli
bulldozer can be seen uncovering the Israelis say, a tunnel used to
smuggle weapons. Moments later, three journalists who were covering
that Israeli action appear. One with TV labeled on the back of a
bullet-proof vest, another carrying a white flag. Judging from the
videotape, they appear difficult to see in the darkness. And difficult
to hear. After the journalists shout, another gunshot. Moments later,
another shot and the sound of someone in pain. 34-year-old British
journalist James Miller died on the scene after Israeli soldiers come
to his aid, the Israeli defense sources says. He is best known for his
work on two award-winning documentaries which appeared on CNN exposing
the world to the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Now the Foreign Press
Association in Israel is calling for an independent investigation.

James was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting. So,
again, to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry.

the Israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that
Miller was shot in the back, suggesting he could have been hit by
Palestinian gunmen. Those close to Miller believe he was shot by an
armored Israeli personnel carrier. We know the Israelis fired. Whether
or not he was shot by Israelis gunfire, we are not certain at this
time. Miller becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to be
killed covering the israeli-palestinian conflict. With Palestinian
cameramen, shot and killed by an Israeli soldier on the West Bank in
mid-april. With back-to-back deaths making a total of at least seven
journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half
years.

<TURN>
this is very worrying and I believe the Israeli army should take
special measures to prevent this. The message from the Israeli
government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists, but
that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire
exchange between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen have a
responsibility to take greater precautions.
</TURN>
<TURN>
they have to realize that this is not a game going on there. It's a
life and death situation. Soldiers are basically thinking about their
own lives at that moment. They don't have time to hesitate. The
Israeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice, but to be there.
