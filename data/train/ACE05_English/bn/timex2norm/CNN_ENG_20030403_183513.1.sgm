Pentagon tonight said coalition troops have reached Baghdad
International Airport. Troops are involved in heavy
fighting with Iraqi forces. The Pentagon says the strategy
is to seize key objectives in and around Baghdad. Reports
suggesting airport buildings have been attacked, but
runways remain operational. Tonight, a series of large
explosions rocking central Baghdad, as we've been reporting
to you over the course of this hour. Coalition aircraft

International Airport although there have been strikes in
central Baghdad as well. In the course of the past hour.
