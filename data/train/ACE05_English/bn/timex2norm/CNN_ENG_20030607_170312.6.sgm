we now return to "people in the news."
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: For Martha Stewart seems business is everything.
And everywhere. Stewart has found the road to fortune
wherever she has traveled.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I think the temptation for any successful entrepreneur to
go global.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Her Marketing Vision also included Kmart a
company that recently emerged from bankruptcy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
okay, girls.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Stewart is associated with Kmart since 1987 and
been very successful. The goal had been to bring affordable
style to the Masse
</TURN>
<TURN>
there's a reason she was successful. And the stuff that
she's created people like.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it's good. It's useful. It's appealing. It's attractive and
it's cheap.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Even as Kmart struggled through financial
difficulties, Stewart stuck by the company.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it's hard to run out on a partner that's down. That's not
our style.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Now Stewart is hoping people don't run out on
her. The celebrity indicted on charges stemming from the
sale of imclone stock. Stewart and former imclone CEO Sam
Waksal shared a broker who now also faces charges of
obstruction of justice and perjury.
</TURN>
<TURN>
her defense has been that she had a standing sell order at
$60 and when the stock fell below 60 the broker supposed
to, you know make the trade. She's been standing with that
story. The broker standing by that story. The only reason
it's not holding is because there are other people that the
Merrill Lynch that investigated and didn't find proof that
was actually the case.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: After Stewart was charged by federal authorities
Wednesday, her lawyers issued a statement in which they
said, quote, Martha Stewart has done nothing wrong. The
accusation that Martha Stewart sold the imclone shares
based on inside information proved to be false.
</TURN>
<TURN>
if she lied, then that is the obstruction of justice
charge. That's the criminal side. That's where the prison
time comes in.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: for Stewart, the fallout from the past year taken
a tremendous toll.
</TURN>
<TURN>
Martha Stewart told me that the investigation itself had
cost her about $400 million. In decline in her stock, legal
fees, and lost business opportunities.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Ironic, considering the sale of the imclone stock
resulted in a gain of less than $50,000.
</TURN>
<TURN>
she'll never fully recover. You know, it's almost like E.G.
you get off the hook, but are you really off the hook
because people always believe you were guilty. And it's
hard to win back that sort of brand equity that she's lost.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Stewart is vowing to clear her name of the
charges.
</TURN>
<TURN>
she is so focused and so determined that this
investigation, while terribly upsetting, has not been
something that's stood in her way. As only she would, she
said, look, I don't lose any sleep. I still sleep my three
or four hours a night.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: He says Stewart is still taken aback by the
reaction to her legal troubles.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I think she's been stunned at how much joy so many people
have taken at her misfortune. She doesn't quite understand
that the perfectionism that made her so famous also makes
people say, Oh, isn't it fun to see someone like that have
a big, big problem?
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: A perfectionism reflected in even the smallest
details of Stewart's life.
</TURN>
<TURN>
Martha doesn't like to talk about how unpleasant things
have been, but you can get signals of it in surprising
ways. When we sat down to lunch, she had put out these
beautiful chop sticks which I commented Orion. She said, in
China, the person with the thinnest chop sticks has the
highest social status. And of course, I had to get the
thinnest chop sticks. Then she paused and said, that's why
people hate me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Love Her or hate her, Martha Stewart has tied
every aspect of her image to her business. Even her daily
calendar turned into a marketing tool.
</TURN>
<TURN>
she said to me once that my life is "the Truman show" and
meant I'm always on. From the time I get up until I go to
bed, the whole world is watching.
</TURN>
<TURN>
Hello, everyone. Did you
