more now on the Louisiana serial killings. And the arrest
of the prime suspect, Derrick Lee Tee Lee W.''re joined on
the phone by the police chief of Atlanta. Can Owe tell us
exactly the details, the precise details of how you
arrested the suspect?
</TURN>
<TURN>
yes, we can. First of all, members of my fugitive unit had
been looking for the suspect, Derrick Lee all day based on
information we received from the Baton Rouge police chief
and the serial murder task force back in the state of
Louisiana. This evening, about 8:45 p.m., members of my
fugitive unit received a telephone call from an informtive
saying they thought that they had observed the suspect
Derrick Lee in the area of woods drive and Donald Lee
Holland Parkway in southwest Atlanta. The officers
responded to that location. Noticed a suspect fitting the
description, approached Derrick Lee. Asked for
identification. Derrick Lee produced Louisiana
identification. He was arrested without incident. Taken
into custody and he's currently at Atlanta Police
Department headquarters pending extradition back to the
state of Louisiana.

tire shop, and someone noticed him, recognized him. Made a
call to the fugitive unit. We went out this evening about
8:45, and sure enough, he was the person we were looking
for all day.
