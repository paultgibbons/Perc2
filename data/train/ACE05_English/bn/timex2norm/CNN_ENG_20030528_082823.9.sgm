it's been four years since the U.S. women's soccer team
made history winning the World Cup before more than 90,000
fans at the Rose Bowl. Everybody remembers that scene.

The Super Bowl of women's soccer is returning to the U.S.
after concerns about SARS in China prompted a change in
venue for this year's tournament. Lynn Morgan President of
the Soccer Association is one of those who has the job of
organizing this global event that has only got four months
to get put together instead of four years as usual and she
joins us from Atlanta this morning. You see her there. In
Washington, with us now is Mia Hamm, one of the stars of
the '99 U.S. team. She's now playing for the Washington
freedom of the Wusa. Ladies, thanks for coming out and
talking with us this morning. Mia, when you heard the news
about China now saying they want the U.S. to run the
tournament, when you heard that, did you think this is a
pleasant surprise or you got to be kidding?
