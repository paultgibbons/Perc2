Sharon Osbourne did not enjoy her meal at a Los Angeles restaurant
last night. Ozzy's wife reportedly got into a fight with Hollywood
agent Renee Tab. Sharon spit on Tab and called her names. Osbourne's
spokeswomen says Sharon was quote, "viciously assaulted and treated at
a hospital." Disagreement between the women began months ago when
Osbourne said Tab atended her family's New Year's Eve party uninvited
and then won the door prize, a $15,000 necklace. A spokesman says that
if any charges are filed, they will be on the low end of the
misdemeanor scale.
