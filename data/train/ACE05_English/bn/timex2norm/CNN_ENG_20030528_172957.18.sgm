a defense attorney calls it his worst nightmare. A convicted murderer
is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a
nightmare becomes reality. It happened last week. Michael Sears was
determined to prove he was no longer a threat. His psychiatrist backed
him up. Serious was serving a 30-year sentence for the self-confessed
1992 killing of his wife in Clinton, Maryland, but after a relentless
campaign that included a letter from his psychiatrist saying serious
was unlikely to commit such violence again, the judge in this case,
got him released. He served less than nine years. Maryland is the only
state that allows unchecked judicial reconsideration, allowing judges
to reduce prison terms at any time after sentencing. Those favoring
the rule say it gives convicts incentive to behave in prison and
enables judges to release prisoners if new evidence comes to light. At
some point after his release, Michael Serious befriended a woman named
Darlene Williamson. Last week Williamson, a mother of four, was found
stabbed to death at a condominium in Greenbelt, Maryland. The official
resident of that Condo, the man now charged with her murder, Michael
Serious. Today the judge in the case retired Prince Georges County
Circuit Court judge issued a statement to the news media. He called
the case and I'm quoting now, a judge's worst nightmare, but he noted
that Maryland Parole Boards and the facility where Michael Serious was
held, the institution made what the judge called the final decision on
whether to release serious. The psychiatrist, by the way, who wrote a
letter on Michael Serious' behalf, Neil Blumberg had a two-word
response in an article in the Washington Post. My goodness, he was
pretty surprised. Serious' defense attorney who persuaded the judge
reduce the sentence, told the Post and I'm quoting, I'm very saddened.
It makes me sick as a defense attorney. As a defense attorney it's
your worst nightmare. Let's get perspective on this shocking case.
Glen I'vey is the Prince Georges County, Maryland, state attorney. It
doesn't get more shocking than this. How could this happen?
