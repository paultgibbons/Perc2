that her younger sister, Mary Katherine, was the one
who went to her father and said, "Dad, I think I know who
did this." But it took some four months before they were
able to get a picture and identify the picture as this
Brian David Mitchell and then his wife, Wanda Barzee. The
other questions, of course, are why didn't Elizabeth Smart
Try to escae? Were there opportunities perhaps that she
might ab vible to -- able to get away from her abductors?
The police are saying she was abducted by knife point and
was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear
factor going on. We are seeing a lot locally here some
photographs that are coming out that show the three, that
show Mitchell, his wife, and who they believe to be
Elizabeth Smart at a party in September. There were times
perhaps they were in a park somewhere in Salt Lake City
completely robed in these veiled and robes so you could not
see her face. There are a lot of questions coming out about
why she could not get away from them, that remains to be
answered. The police are going to be holding a press
conference later today. We're hoping to get more details
about that.
