German police say a teenage Lebanese gunman, who hijacked a bus today,
was hoping to free a key September 11th suspect. The gunman is accused
of commandeering the bus in the north German city of Bremen and
holding 16 people hostage during a 75-mile police chase down the
Autobahn. Negotiators say he demanded the release of four prisoners,
including Ramzi Binalshibh, a September 11th suspect apprehended last
year in Pakistan. Police captured the 17-year-old hijacking suspect
without firing a shot. All hostages were released unharmed.
