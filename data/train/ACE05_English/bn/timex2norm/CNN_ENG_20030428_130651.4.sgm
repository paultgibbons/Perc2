an international tourist in New York City did most of his
sight seeing inside a hospital. Health officials say they
had to forcibly detain the man who exhibited possible SARS
symptoms. Officials say the unnamed tourist had knicks
tickets and was determined to use them. Here are some
numbers to put the spread of SARS in perspective for you.
Across the globe, there have been almost 5,000 documented
cases of SARS in 27 different countries. China, the country
where SARS originated, has been the hardest hit, with
thousands of cases and more than 100 deaths. Here in the
United States, however, there have been no deaths among the
41 probable cases of SARS. 17 states have probable cases
while another 21 states have suspected cases. But just to
put the threat of SARS in perspective, in the United
States, 284 people died last year from the West Nile virus
while 36,000 people die every year from the flu.
