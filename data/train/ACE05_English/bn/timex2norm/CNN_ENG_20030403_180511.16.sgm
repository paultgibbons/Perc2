bombardment of Baghdad continues tonight and over the past
20 minutes, explosions rocking Baghdad, central Baghdad
southern Baghdad, the outskirts of Baghdad, and
importantly, as the coalition forces, principally U.S. army
forces, move against Saddam Hussein International Airport
-- which is about ten miles outside the center of Baghdad
-- Those explosions are intensifies. If we may again going
to the wide screen of what appears to me to be Abu Dhabi
television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m. in
Baghdad, live pictures again. That it is very difficult to
discern whether or not that is, in point of fact, the
missiles that we have become accustomed to striking Baghdad
and its environs, or whether it is the large 2,000 pound
jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the
coalition in Baghdad, or whether these flashes now
represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take
control of the -- to take control of Saddam International
Airport. Again, correspondents, our correspondents with the
-- embedded with these forces, with them in the field,
saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline
of Baghdad. Over the course of the past two weeks, since
this war began, something like 23,000 coalition sorties
have been flown, and over the course of the past 24 hours,
1,900 sorties flown. And we are told that, of those, 850
were strike sorties, motor vehicle most of those directed
against the Republican Guard. As you know, the Republican
Guard just outside Baghdad to defend the city and Saddam
Hussein's regime, in principal. Two of those divisions
absolutely devastated, destroyed. The so-called Medina
Division, and the Baghdad Division. The Baghdad division,
of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the
Republican Guard division designated to defend principally
Baghdad. Four other divisions we are told have also been
hit very, very very hard and are principally trying to
reinforce units va also been hit very hard. So we are
seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are
calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one
person from the center of Baghdad. And that raises
questions, questions that have been in front of us since
that first strike on March 19th against the location that
the CIA military intelligence thought was a place where
Saddam Hussein, perhaps his sons, were. That preemptive
strike they put, I think somewhat elegantly, trying to
strike at the head of the snake. New Explosions rocking
parts of Baghdad tonight. We will continue to monitor that.
We, of course, will bring the word to you just as soon as
the army and coalition forces do take control of Saddam
Hussein International Airport, just on the outskirts of
Baghdad. In southern Iraq today, British forces also moving
closer to the center of the second largest city in Iraq,
Basra. They captured an Iraqi base in an unused factory in
the southern suburbs of that city. Tim Hewart of ITN
reports.
