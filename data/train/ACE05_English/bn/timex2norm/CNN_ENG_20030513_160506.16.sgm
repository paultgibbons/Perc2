as we told you at the top of this newscast, an Oklahoma judge has
ruled that Terry Nichols will indeed stand trial in that state court
on 160 counts of first-degree murder. The Oklahoma City bombing
conspirator is already serving a life term in federal prison. State
proceedings could bring the death penalty if Nichols is convicted. A
trial date was not immediately set by the judge whose decision came as
prosecutes were still presenting evidence. A Texas woman is in jail
this morning accused of killing her two sons and severely beating
another the day before mother's Day. Yesterday a silent Dee Ana Laney
waited as the judge read the charges against her. Capital murder and

it's been talked about quite a bit the last few days and if anybody
didn't have to be there to see it, they were lucky not to have to be
there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it was a horrific sight, you don't have to go into details, obviously,
we can only imagine how bad it might have been. It probably was,
indeed, based on your eyewitness accounts. What happened? They were
collecting evidence as you were there, the law enforcement
authorities?
</TURN>
<TURN>
they had been collecting their evidence and, of course, when I got
there they showed me the location and, of course, then having to do
