we begin we will finish. [ applause ]d the extra $400 per child to
American families this year, 2003. All together these tax reductions
will help 92 million Americans. And a significant part of the benefit
to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan. A
family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction
in federal income taxes. Instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family
would pay $45 a year. [ applause ] that means extra money in the
family budget year after year. That money can cover a lot of bills.
That money can help families with purchases they have been delaying.
That money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy.
[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector. The
benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending
and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small
businesses themselves. It is important for our fellow citizens to
understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the
individual rates. Most small businesses are sole proprietorships,
limited partnerships, are subchapter SS, and, therefore, when you
reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation. As
a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business
owners will see their taxes cut. which leaves more money for
investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation. A
growing economy also needs small business investment. And our tax code
should encourage investment. Today a small business can deduct a
maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment. We need to
triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy
equipment. [ applause ] so I propose to Congress that they ought to
limit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought
to be indexed to inflation. By doing so, we promote greater investment
in machinery. And when a small business bias machine that enhances
their company's product divty as well as it means machinery
manufacturer is likely to have more work available. More investment
equals jobs. And what we are interested in in this administration is
helping people who look for work find a job. [ applause ] we can also
promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on
dividends. [ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair. It is
not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice. The
burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who
receive dividends. Falls especially hard on seniors who receive half
of all dividend income. Removal of double taxation would put more
money in the hands of investors. It would encourage more investment in
American businesses. Economists say that this plan will help our stock
markets, and since half of American families own stock, the reform
will help them save and help our economy grow. Now, these measures
were presented to Congress in the first week of this year. The pro
growth package was urgent in January. It's even more urgent today. [
applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our
fellow Americans to understand the tax relief that I have proposed and
will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create
1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004. In two years time, this
nation has experienced war, a recession and a national emergency.
which has caused our government to run a deficit. The best way to
reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means
more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in Washington, D.C. [
applause ] I am pleased that both the House and Senate have passed
budget resolutions that show real spending restraint. And now the
Congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package. We need
at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that
goes to the American people, the more jobs we will create in this
economy. [ applause ] the last few months have been a time of
challenge for America. Our resolve has been tested. Yet we have the
great resources of national strength. And national character. To
overcome every challenge we face. Our confidence an our optimism have
never waivered. We are defending the peace of the world. We're
bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in
years. We're all building the prosperity of our country. This is a
unique moment in our history and the American people are rising to
meet it. I want to thank each of you for your hard work. I want to
thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's
future. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America. [
applause ]
