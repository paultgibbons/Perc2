today at a small Israeli grocery store in Israel, but near the West
Bank board. The store's owner and the Palestinian bomber were killed.
The store is a total loss. The Israelis, 63 years old was in the
store, there's some indication the Palestinian suicide bomber had
expected more Israelis to be inside, but there weren't any other
Israelis there he blew himself up apparently as a result, the
investigation is continuing. Islamic Jihad has so far claimed
responsibility for that. Secretary of State Colin Powell says some
progress is being made despite all of this, towards a truce involving
Palestinian militants. Powell is wrapping up a trip to Southeast Asia,
he's due here in Jerusalem tomorrow morning for talks with the Israeli
Prime Minister and the foreign minister. Later, he's supposed to
helicopter to Jericho on the West Bank to meet with the Palestinian
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas.
