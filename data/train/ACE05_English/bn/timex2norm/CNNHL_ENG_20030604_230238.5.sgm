welcome and good evening, everyone. Mike is off tonight. To
our top story of the evening -- Martha Stewart is stepping
down as head of her media empire. She announced her
decision to vacate her post as chief executive of Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia, following word of a federal
indictment. In a statement, she says she's stepping aside
in the best interest of the company, but she will stay on
the board of directors. Stewart pleaded not guilty to a
nine-count indictment. The charges include conspiracy to
obstruct justice and perjury connected to an insider
trading scandal. The government also filed civil charges
against her. She is charged with using insider information
to bail out of a biotech stock the day before its price
tanked, and then trying to cover it up. Her stockbroker was
also charged. If convicted on all counts, Stewart faces up
to 30 years in prison and $2 million in fines.
