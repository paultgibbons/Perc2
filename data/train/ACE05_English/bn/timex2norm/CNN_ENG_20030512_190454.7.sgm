the story of a woman in an east Texas jail cell tonight. We're told
sometimes she sits in the fetal position, Other Times Singing Gospel
Music. Occasionally she'll pray, sometimes cries hysterically. Her
name is Deanna Lejeune Laney. She's accused of beating two of her
three children to death because, she says, God told her to. Now that
happened this Saturday. Today the wheels of justice began turning.
Katherine Garcia of WFAA joins from us the Smith County courthouse in
Tyler, Texas.
