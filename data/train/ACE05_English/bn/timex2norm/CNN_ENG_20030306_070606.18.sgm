good morning. A crazy world we live in. The Supreme Court
of the United States upheld the toughest three strikes law
in the country yesterday. That's California's. They
rejected challenges to the law of sentences of 25 years to
life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some
golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some

passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient
judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap
of the wrist. They appealed to the Supreme Court on behalf
of these two people. Currently in California, 7000 people
serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes
law. one-third of them -- not that. 300 of them are in
there for things like petty theft. 25 other states that
have the three strikes law. And that brings us to the
question. It was a close vote. 5-4 In the Supreme Court.

it suffered at the hands of its mother and she's free. Five
years probation for killing her 4-year-old by scalding it
to death in the bathtub. That is the
