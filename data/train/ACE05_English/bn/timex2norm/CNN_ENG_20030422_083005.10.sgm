I'm Allan Chernoff at the New York Stock Exchange. American
Airlines, a second Major Union at American is planning a
new vote on the company's cost cutting agreement. The
unions are outraged that a bonus plan for top executives
that had not been fully disclosed before the Union voted to
take pay cuts. The Transport Brokers Union made the revote
last night moments before the CEO publicly apologized to
his employees. Carty said he thought the employees would
like the plan that meant to keep the executives that
company. But he concealed the details fearing the story
would cause problems when they were asking employees for
big concessions. Shares of American Airlines are falling
sharply for the second straight day on the fears that the
company might be forced to file for bankruptcy. The stock
market has bounced back from a weak start. A lot more
earning's reports out today, many positive, a few
disappointments sprinkled in, as well. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is up by 16 points right now and the
Nasdaq composite higher by 6 points.
