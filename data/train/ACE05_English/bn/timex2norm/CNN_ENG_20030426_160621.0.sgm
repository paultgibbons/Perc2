* * The "USS Abraham Lincoln." It's a guided missile destroyer. They
fired off 50 Tomahawk missiles during "Operation Iraqi Freedom." You
talk about the capability of this ship. The other mission that it took
part in was the operations before t fall of the Saddam Hussein and his
regime. They were out there taking down illegal smugglers and going
out and boarding the ships. Now, also, this ship played an important
part within the war and that's because of the radar system. It could
detect objects smaller than a honey bee. What does that mean? It can
detect enemy radar or missiles and destroy them instantly. They were a
big part in "Operation Iraqi Freedom." You are seeing the pictures,
everybody is home. Friends and family connecting. Haven't seen each
other in almost 10 months now. 14 fathers have not seen their babies.
They all reunited with their families. We got to meet up with one such
family. We'll show you pictures of the GALETTA family. Katie was born
on Christmas Day, Anderson. This is the first time her father got to
hold her and look in her eyes since he came back from "Operation Iraqi
Freedom." 130 sailors really excited to be home back on land after
being at sea for nearly 10 months carrying out "Operation Iraqi
Freedom." Some remarkable stories. We're looking at now, a sailor
seeing his baby for the first time, just remarkable. Kyra Phillips, we
appreciate you bringing it to us today.
