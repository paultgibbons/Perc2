Ari Fleischer expected to come into the West wing briefing room to
brief reporters on a wide variety of subjekts. We're all getting this
note in, this news in from the speech that the Homeland Security
Secretary Tom Ridge is expected to be delivering at the International
Press Club around 1:00 Eastern at the top of the hour. We're expecting
that the Homeland Security Secretary will announce the Iraqi lawyer
who provided information that helped in the rescue op Private First
Class Jessica Lynch the former P.O.W., that this Iraqi lawyer, who
provided the information to U.S. military authority IES has been
granted asylum here in the United States, together with his wife and
daughter. They're currently in the Washington, D.C. area. An official
tells our justice producer Terry Frieden. So that development
important. Might get more information from Secretary Tom Ridge when he
delivers that speech over at the Press Club in the next hour. We'll be
monitoring that as well. We also have an update on that disturbing
development outside Baghdad. About 40 miles or so outside Baghdad in
Fallujah where there was h a shootout between U.S. troops and Iraqies
who had been demonstrating there. Karl penhaul is joining us life on
