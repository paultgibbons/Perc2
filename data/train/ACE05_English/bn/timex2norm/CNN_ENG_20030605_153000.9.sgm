let's look now at a potential rising star from the next
generation in the sports realm. The National Basketball
Association holds its draft on the 26th of this month. Ohio
High School Player, High School, we said, Lebron James,
will be the top dog. Most likely drafted by the Cleveland
Cavaliers get the first pick because of their status. James
already scored back in a $90 million nike deal. $90
million. But when bafblgt ball fans were asked in a
CNN/"USA Today" poll just how good james will be, 18% say
he'll be among the best. Slim margin. Most think he'll be
very good. Another 18% are convinced he'll be just average
or below. Skeptical fans. As for that $90 million shoe
contract with Nike, it may be a good deal for James. No
doubt about that. 33% of basketball fans see it as a bad
deal for Nike. They must know something about shoes.
