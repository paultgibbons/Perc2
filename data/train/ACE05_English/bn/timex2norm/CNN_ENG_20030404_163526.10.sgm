we turn now to an Iraqi -- first of all, before we tell you
about this story, we were going to, these are live pictures
from Baghdad. There's been some activity in the last few
moments. Looks like tracer fire we're looking at,
anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort
of threat coming from the skies. Baghdad has had sporadic
episodes of this tonight. No major explosions we're aware
of, but just, apparently, in the last few moments, there
has been activity. You can see it there just now. We've
been reporting, the city has begun to see its electricity
turned back on. We don't know that all ofist is back, but
at least some of it is. We also know that 12 miles
southwest of the city, coalition forces remain largely in
control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International
Airport, now renamed by the coalition Baghdad International
Airport. But the coalition is quick to point out that they
do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the
airport. Again, this is -- these are live pictures of
Baghdad, where it is well into the night. We're, of course,
going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you
up to speed on anything we learn.
