two southwest airline pilots were reportedly fired for stripping down.
It wasn't part of a security check. "USA Today" says the pilots were
dismissed for allegedly taking off all or most of their clothes in the
cockpit. I want to make that distinction there. The pilots are calling
the SDEBT -- Incident a misunderstanding and appealing their
termination.
