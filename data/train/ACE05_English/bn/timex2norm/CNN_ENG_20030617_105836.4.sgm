and now joining us by phone from Liverpool with more on the Harry
Potter Heist is Caroline Forham, press officer with the mercy side
police. It's come to stealing childrens books, is it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
I think these are profitable childrens book. So very popular. I think
that people think they probably are lucrative for them. As you
mentioned, if anyone is seen to be selling these on the black market
they will be prosecuted.
</TURN>
<TURN>
is that why you think they were stolen, sale before the deadline or
after?
</TURN>
<TURN>
I think probably they know they can make more money before the
deadline on these books. But I know no reputable book shop will take
these stolen goods and sell them. I think we are looking at in market
stores and sales over the next coming days. We have police officers
looking for them and will prosecute anyone seen selling them or buying
them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
considering how much publicity was circulating about this book, there
is injunctions about publishing anything or talking about the plot.
What kind of security was there in place for any truck carrying books?
</TURN>
<TURN>
the books were stolen from a warehouse, they have their own security
measures. They did have their CCPB operational, we are looking at that
to see if
