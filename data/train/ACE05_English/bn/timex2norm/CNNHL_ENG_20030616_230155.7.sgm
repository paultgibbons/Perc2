the Bush administration is officially endorsing the pro-democracy
demonstrations in Iran. For a week now, protesters have been clashing
with police and backers of the clerical regime in Tehran. In turn, the
Iranian government has accused the Bush administration of providing
material support to the protesters. The State Department spokesman
says the demonstrations are about Iran and Iranians, and have nothing
to do with the U.S., but he did make it clear where U.S. sympathies
lie.
