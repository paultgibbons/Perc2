we're getting word developing news on this Middle East situation. We
are getting word that U.S. Ambassador to Israel has delivered the
White House Middle East Road Map for peace to Ariel Sharon, the
Israeli prime minister. In part, it declares the Palestinian state
working towards that end and within three years, the year 2005, you're
going to hear a lot of talk about this later today and throughout the
morning on CNN. The other thing we're watching right now, take you
live to Baghdad inside what used to be the Saddam Hussein
International Airport. Now named the Baghdad International Airport. We
anticipate in a matter of moments, the Secretary of Defense, Donald
Rumsfeld, to arrive inside of this hangar and we'll carry his speech
live when that gets underway. -- Captions by VITAC -- www.vitac.com
