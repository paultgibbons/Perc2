we begin tonight talking about the way the justice system
deals with those accused or suspected of terrorism, and
we'll talk more about that in just a moment. First, though
with some believe is a case in point from Tampa, Florida,
Samuel Arianna a former college professor in Florida who
was arrested in February and charged of being a North
America head of a Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. He was
told today he will have his DMAI court. Only his day in
court won't come until January 2005. Lawyers for the three
men arrested with him say they need that much time to go
over the government's evidence and prepare their case. Two
of the indicted men are out on bond, but Samiel Aryan and
other defendant are held without bond which is to say they
will stay in jail until the trial starts in roughly 18
months. This conflict over individual liberty and national
security is hardly new. President Lincoln dealt with it
during the civil war, F.D.R. did in World War II, and it is
often true that decisions made in the heat of a moment, a
war or after an attack look pretty good at the time, not so
good as time passes. Whether that is true now, we cannot
say. Others, however, have thoughts and Mr. Barr is among
them. A Republican from the state of Georgia. Former
prosecutor and about the last person on the planet that you
would ever call ablying liberal. He joins US tonight. We
are always glad to see him. Congressman, good evening.
