Convicted Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols will stand
trial again on state murder charges. Nichols is serving a life term
for his federal manslaughter and conspiracy convictions stemming from
the deaths of eight federal employees in the 1995 blast. An Oklahoma
City judge has ruled prosecutors presented enough evidence at a
preliminary hearing to try Nichols on murder charges for the other 160
victims of the attack. They will seek the death penalty. Timothy
mcveigh, convicted of setting off the bomb that destroyed the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building, was executed nearly two years ago.
