a pizza delivery helped police nab the suspect in the kidnapping of a
9-year-old California girl. 24-year-old Enrique Alvarez, also known as
David Cruz, was arrested Monday in San Jose. He is expected to be
arraigned Wednesday. He's charged with kidnapping, felony assault and
sexual assault. The girl was found late Sunday at a convenience store
in East Palo Alto. Police say she told them a pepperoni pizza had been
delivered to the house where she was held. Detectives were able to
track the order to the house, where they found Alvarez hiding in the
attic.
