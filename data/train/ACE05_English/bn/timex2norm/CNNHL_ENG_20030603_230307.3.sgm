good evening. Welcome, everyone. Mike Galanos is off tonight. Our Top
story -- Eric Robert Rudolph has officially said he didn't do it. He
pleaded not guilty to bombing a Birmingham women's clinic in 1998. The
suspected serial bomber appeared in a federal courthouse Tuesday
afternoon. He is also suspected in three atlanta-area bombings. North
Carolina authorities say Rudolph opened up to them about his five
years on the run. He says he hunted wild animals, searched the trash
for food, and covered himself with leaves to make it through the
winters.
