adrenaline is high on the flight deck of this carrier at
war. Soon after dawn on this fourth day, confirmation of
the ship's first strike.
</TURN>
<TURN>
fourth day of combat operations today bore fruit for the
air wing and the ship team here. We had f-14 aircraft drop
laser-guided bombs, f-18s drop joint direct attack
munitions or J-DAM weapons into eastern Afghanistan today
this is the first of an unknown number of strikes we'll
conduct during our watch in "Operation Enduring Freedom."
</TURN>
<TURN>
they'll come back high fiving and feeling pretty good about
it but it is a bit of a somber event that they're going
through out here. But the biggest thing you're seeing is
the intensity.

reporter: The fighter jets dropped their ordnance in a
coordinated atack on a convoy near the Afghan city of
Choft. The Pentagon says the convoy was Taliban and al
Qaeda troops.
</TURN>
<TURN>
there was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was
identified through various intelligence means. That was
done within the last 24 hours.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: But the strikes prove controversial. Local
Afghans in the convoy say it was a group of elders on their
way to the inaugural ceremony for interim Afghan leader
Hamid Karzai. Analysts believe some tribal warlords may
have taken advantage of American firepower by accuse ING
RIFE AAL leaders of being Taliban and misguiding U.S.
intelligence.

<TURN>
the consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is
friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to
deal with. A. And we go extreme details in -- and do a lot
of training as well to make sure that doesn't happen.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we have dropped ordnance today. And I'm sure we'll continue
to drop ordnance. And do it with precision, do it with
accuracy, and do it on call when needed first time every
time. Holy, holy, holy

reporter: As the "John C. Stennis" ends its first week of
operations in the Arabian Sea, Christmas is only a few days
away. Though a choir rehearses in the chapel for a
Christmas event, for the crew, it is another workday, their
first day off won't be for another three weeks.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it is another day for me. When I'm out here, I don't look
at a calendar, I don't think about it. I stay busy at work.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: But there are other chances for the SMIP to
gather like this moment of pride to honor sailors who
earned a promotion in rank. It is called a frocking
ceremony.
</TURN>
<TURN>
there is a sense of respect that you'll agree as you walk
around this crew is there. As they take care of one another
the whole community comes together they follow together as
a team or they win together as a team. And I always
encourage them to take care of themselves. Because if they
don't care of themselves, then it kind of all falls apart
at the seams.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: Last time we saw this sailor he was washing
dishes in the Ghali. Now he's been promoted. And Pilots
Sarah "Clutch" Joiner and Russ "Gladys" Knight say their
final good-byes.

reporter: Before boarding a cargo flight off the "USS
Stennis." They'll be home in time for Christmas.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I've been here for four and a half years. It is probably
time to go. But I'm going miss them. They're pretty much my
family right now, or my family away from my family.

reporter: Savoring every last minute on the ship, Commander
Knight Rushes to the flight only seconds before the door
closes.

<TURN>
had is the best tour of my life. 19 years in the navy, it
has been the best tour of my life.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: For the rest of the crew, there is five more
months to go in this deployment. And no one knows how long
America's new war on terrorism will keep the "USS John C.
Stennis" engaged in battle. On highest alert as a carrier
at war.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we continue with the pride and professionalism we have
shown to date, we can't do anything but be successful.
Please make sure you take care of your ship, take care of
yourselves,
