a Palestinian terrorist leader wanted for a deadly 1985 cruise ship
hijacking is in U.S. custody in Iraq. U.S. sources tell CNN Mohammed
"Abu" Abbas was captured about 50 miles west of Baghdad. Palestinian
sources say he had tried to flee into Syria, but was turned away at
the border. In October of 1985, four hijackers under his command took
over the Italian cruise ship "Achille Lauro" and killed a wheelchair-
bound American tourist, Leo Klinghoffer. Abbas was convicted in
absentia by an Italian court and sentenced to five life terms in
prison.
