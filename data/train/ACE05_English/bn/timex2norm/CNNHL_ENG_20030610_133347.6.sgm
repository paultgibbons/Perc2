the founder and former CEO of imclone just learned the
penalty for his role in the pharmaceutical company's
insider trading scandal. Sam Waksal was sentenced to seven
years and three months in federal prison. He's also being
fined $3 million and was ordered to pay $1.2 million in
restitution to the New York State Tax Commission. Waksal
pleaded guilty last fall to six counts of security fraud,
bank fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury.
He's being released on his own cog in a sans before he's to
report to jail. Waksal admitted to tipping his daughter to
dump imclone stock market just ahead of a drug rejection
the company was developing and he pleaded guilty to bank
fraud by forging a signature on a $44 million loan. The
imclone scandal led to charges against Waksal's friend,
Martha Stewart, last week over her sale of the stock the
day before the price collapsed.
