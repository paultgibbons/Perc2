in today's Daily News, a 60-year-old woman acknowledges she
was the 19-year-old White House intern who slept with JFK.
She told the papers, "I am the Mimi." I want to take this
opportunity to stand behind the Mimi and proclaim my
solidarity. I know where you've been because I too have
been there myself. That's right, I too slept with JFK. I am
the Anderson. I was born four years too late to have slept
with JFK? Technically correct but why quibble over details?
Isn't it possible deep down, that you also slept with JFK?
WHO, me? No, I couldn't have, you protest. Believe whatever
you have to. I am not willing to live that lie any longer.
The truth about our camelot obsessed society is each of us
in our own way has slept with the JFK. Only once we admit
this to ourselves individually and as a nation can the true
healing begin. A thought to end on tonight. Thanks for
being with US tonight. Stay with CNN. "Larry King Live" is
next.
