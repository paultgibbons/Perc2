bringing you up to date on a breaking story out of the
Middle East. In Gaza, a pair of Israeli gun ship attack,
aerial attacks that have threatened to derail the road map
to peace, as it is called. In the first attack, a car
carrying Rantissi, a senior member of the Hamas group, a
militant organization, was targeted. He survived, with
wound, but two people were killed. 27 others were injured
in that attack. The second attack occurred after some
rocket firings aimed, apparently, toward the Israelis,
apparently in retaliation. We're checking our facts on that
one. That is just unfolding. The White House saying, and
the president directly quoted as saying, he was deeply
troubled by that initial attack. Still no reaction to the
second attack. The details on that still inconclusive. The
president, quoted by Ari Fleischer, his spokesman, is
saying he's concerned the strike will undermine efforts by
Palestinian authorities to bring an end to terrorist
attacks and does not contribute to the security of Israel.
Clearly some frustration with the Sharon government in
Israel in the wake of these attacks in Gaza.
