the struggle for power in a Postsaddam Iraq has begun. A key faction
bidding for control announced it will protest the presence of a
prominent Iraqi exile leader. The head of the Iraqi Democratic
Movement says his group will hold a demonstration in Nasiriyah to
denounce the presence of Ahmad Chalabi. Chalabi is the founder and
leader of the Iraqi National Congress. He was escorted into Iraq
Tuesday by U.S. marines. Chalabi staged his own rally yesterday to
support his bid to become the next leader of Iraq.
