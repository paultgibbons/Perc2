Israel has experienced its fifth suicide bombing in three days. Police
say a bomber blew herself up outside a northern Israel shopping center
when she was stopped by a security guard. Three people plus the bomber
were killed, and at least 30 others were hurt. The French Press Agency
says the militant group "Islamic Jihad" is claiming responsibility.
