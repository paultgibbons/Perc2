moving onto the LACI Peterson case bill, an unusual request from Scott
Peterson's attorney. A pair of LACI Peterson's missing shoes could be
very important evidence in Scott's murder trial. She asking anyone who
finds the pair to give them back. No sign of GERAGOS or Peterson in
court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal
warrants obtained before Scott Peterson's arrest. Peterson awaiting
trial in the murder of his wife lace sand their unborn son. Joining
us, Beth Caras. Good morning once again. Thanks for being with us.
