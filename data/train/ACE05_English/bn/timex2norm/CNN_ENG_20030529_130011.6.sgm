well, their 15 minutes on top of the world brought them 50
years of fame. Today, Sir Edmund Hillary being named an
honorary citizen of Nepal. To mark his historic climb to
the top of Mt. Everest with Sherpa Norgay. There is concern
climbing everest has become too common, and perhaps a bit
too commercial. I don't think we have that. We don't have
anything to demonstrate that commercialality. All Right,
let's show you a little bit Mt. Everest, the highest summit
on the planet. Some 3D imagery. There, you see, the big
picture of the southern part of Asia. We'll bring you down
into the him La Yas. 20 million years ago, they were formed
when India broke off what was then a piece of Africa and
slammed into that portion of Asia, creating this tremendous
mountain range, with of course Mt. Everest at 29,000 feet
above sea level. The highest peak of them all. This 3d
animation kind of exaggerates it a little bit. What I
should tell you is there are about 15 possible routes to
get you to the top of Mt. Everest. What Sir Edmund Hillary
did and norgay did was go along this route that takes them
across this valley -- you have to turn the picture this way
a little bit, shoot back over this range, and bring you up
in here. Then I'll try to give you my best guess tell
station. Basically, right along this ridge line up to
29,000 feet, into thin air, as it was popular coined by the
book by the name of John Crack Cower a few years ago. Since
that, a lot of peek have tried, a lot of people have
succeeded. 175 people have died trying to reach the summit
of Mt. Everest. We're joined by our guest -- where is our
guest, by the way? Who is in Kathmandu. And how's the party
going there? Are you there?
