all lumber, no filler. That's the verdict after baseball
officials x-rayed Sam why Sosa's entire inventory of bat
and found no evidence of cork or any other substance. That
seems to support his contention that the bat got him
ejected Tuesday night was a fluke. Still a decision on
what, if any punishment he will face in the wake of that
incident Tuesday night. Gary Tuchman standing by in

reporter: Leon, hello to you. Three hours from now the
Chicago cubs take the field against the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays here at Wrigley field and Sammy Sosa will be out there
with them but how long will he? We could find out today.
His punishment, suspension for using a corked bat for use
-- which is illegal during a game. Since the incident
33,000 fans in the stands for a night game he received a
standing ovation from almost all of them. I heard a few
boos but almost everyone standing. Not everyone believing
this man's story, which is it was a mistake but he's a hero

They x-rayed the bats. The x-rays all came back negative.

we are, as I said, confident, based on not only the
presence of security in the club house but also the level
of cooperation, the record keeping that we reviewed and so

still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame. But the
media today, they got it like I'm a criminal and that's

reporter: now, why did Sammy Sosa have this corked bat?
Well, he says he has it because he uses it for batting
practice to put on a show for the fans. They asked him how
many times he's used it during batting practice and he says
three or four times. That raises the question does Major
League baseball have a rule about using corked bats during
batting practice. We asked
