seven minutes before the top of the hour. At the beginning
we told but this incredible story about the rescue of three
fishermen in the waters off the coast of Vancouver, stuck
in the waters, Gail Force winds, small boat, they were
rescued by a cruise ship that happened to be in the
neighborhood. Those three men didn't realize how lucky they
were until they were plucked out of the water. We have with
US Captain Kent Ringboard, on board the Royal Caribbean
"Radiance of the seas." I understand you were on board when
this rescue happened. Were you in charge?
</TURN>
<TURN>
yes, that's correct I was in charge.
</TURN>
<TURN>
tell us about what happened here. What was it you were
looking at when you looked out over the waters?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, it was quite windy, gusty winds up to 40, 50 miles an
hour. And it came from southeast. And we got the alarm this
distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning. And we
were on relatively slow speed for the time being, but we of
course, speeded up to the position, which was given, and we
-- after an hour, we spotted the fishing boat in the waters.
</TURN>
<TURN>
these men were in some water that was quite frigid. If they
stayed out there for long they could have suffered severe
tragedy, perhaps. I want to ask you, have you ever done
anything like this? Have you ever seen anything like this
done?
</TURN>
<TURN>
no, I have never seen this type of operation where you have
a fishing vessel disappear, more or less. And that the
survivors, they had to go into the water, pick them up from
the water.
</TURN>
<TURN>
was there any point at which you didn't think you would be
able to pull it off?
</TURN>
<TURN>
sorry, please say again?
</TURN>
<TURN>
was there any point at which you thought you wouldn't be
able to pull it off?
</TURN>
<TURN>
no, absolutely not. We -- we were 100% sure we could make
it, absolutely. Because we came very close to the vessel.
We had our rescue boat out soon. So I felt confident about
it. I saw the fishermen also had the surviving suits on. So
that gave me more time to help.
</TURN>
<TURN>
that was a good thing for them. What about your crew that
was actually involved in the rescue here? Are they trained
for this sort of thing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
yes, they are very much well-trained. We train for this
type of operation at least every 14 days.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I'm hopeful those three fishermen bought you a glass of
wine once you got them on board.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we gave them some.
</TURN>
<TURN>
these incredible pictures. I'm not sure if you have been
able to see some of these pictures playing on the
television sets around the world but we look at these
pictures and think there's no way a cruise ship, as big as
it is, will be able to maneuver into position in these
kinds of heavy seas to save three corks out there on the
water. Amazing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it was interesting. But we had a good maneuvering
capability on
