Iraqi forces are overwhelmed and could soon collapse. Jessica Lynch
says she cannot wait to get home to West Virginia. The 19-year-old
army private spoke to her parents yesterday pie phone from a hospital
in Germany. Greg Lynch says that when he talked to his daughter she
hadn't eaten in eight days and was quite hungry. The Washington Post
is reporting she shot several Iraqi soldiers before she was captured
and she was shot herself, too. Coming up on our next hour, U.S. forces
edged toward the outskirts of Baghdad and we'll tell you what kind of
resistance they're fating from Saddam Hussein's elite Republican
Guard.
