back in this city, a courthouse in Manhattan. Sam Waksal, founder and
former considers O of imclone is scheduled to be sentenced today. He
pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading, bank fraud and
tax evasion. Waksal could be fined $3.5 million, facing a maximum of
75 years in prison, expected, though, to receive about six to seven
years. That's the early indication we've been given. A friend of his,
Martha Stewart, pleaded not guilty last week. The charges related to
her sale of imclone stock. She sold the share as day before bad news
about the company sent the Stock Price Falling. Considerably. Sam
Waksal, sentenced, 10:00 a.m., local time here in New York.
