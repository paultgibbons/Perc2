arthritis. * * We liberated the people of Iraq from a brutal
dictatorship. [translator speaking] we brought greater security to
people of all nations. I want to thank the president for Spain's
diplomatic support before the conflict. [translator speaking] and for
the use of Spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer.
[translator speaking] I also offer my condolences to the family and
friends of the two members of the Spanish media who lost their lives
while covering the hostilities. [translator speaking] both Spain and
the United States are committed to a stable, democratic and peaceful
future for the people of Iraq. [translator speaking] Spain has shown
that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the
people of Iraq. [translator speaking] and I thank you for that help.
[translator speaking] today, I have moved to ease sanctions imposed by
the United States against Iraq's old government. [translator speaking]
first based on the Authority recently given to me by Congress I'm
suspending the Iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of
certain commitment necessary for Iraq's reconstruction. [translator
speaking] secondly,'m directing the secretary to relax sanctions on
American countries and citizens conducting business in Iraq that
contributed to humanitarian reconstruction. [translator speaking]
soon, at the U.N. Security Council, the United States, Great Britain
and Spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions
imposed by the United Nations. [translator speaking] the regime that
the sanctions were directed against no longer rules Iraq. [translator
speaking] and no country in good conscience can support using
sanctions to hold back the hopes of the Iraqi people. [trance lay or
the speaking] across the globe, Spain and America will continue as
strong allys in the war against terror. [translator speaking] today,
the United States took steps to cut off financing for the organization
because of its ties to the ETA. [translator speaking] We believe that
the people of Spain like everywhere have a right to live free from
terror. [translator speaking] we'll also work for a better world
beyond the war on terror. [translator speaking] we're committed to
expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.
[translator speaking] we'll work together to address global poverty in
the terrible diseases such as HIV AIDS. [translator speaking] Spain
and the United States will stand on the side of people everywhere
striving for greater freedom, tolerance and opportunity. [translator
speaking] we're determined to help build peace between the Israelis
and the Palestinians. [translator speaking] last week's confirmation
of Mazen permitted the road map for peace, developed with Russia, the
European Union and the United States. [translator speaking] Spain and
the United States are determined to take advantage of this moment of
opportunity for peace. [translator speaking] I'm grateful for the Wise
Council and Friendship of Jose Maria Aznar. [translator speaking]
[speaking Spanish]
