our founder here at CNN, Ted Turner, has sold more than
half 0 his stake in AOL Time Warner. That's a lot of shares
and a lot of money. Andy Serwer's look into that and the
Mark Muz. If you're investing, why now?

Chitchat in the time life building here at AOL and all over
Wall Street, Ted Turner selling 60 million shares for $800
million, more than half of his stake in the company, he
opens 40 million plus now. Question is, why? Why is he
selling? I think he's begin up. He's at least -- hedging
his bets by keeping 40 million shares but basically he's
decided that the company is not going wait he wants it to
go and he's bailing out. You know, a lot of concern
obviously by people who still own the stock. My point about
this, if Ted Turner were so smart and he's a very smart guy
but he did not sell at the top, okay? He didn't sell at $60.
</TURN>
<TURN>
hind sight would have like to have gotten that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
he believed in the merger like most other people did. We'll
look back five years from now, you can see, he has lost a
lot of money. You know, he still had $1.7 billion, we're
not shedding tears. He did have $8 billion. He's left a lot
on the table. We'll look back five years from now and say,
when the stock is either at $13 still or $8 or $30 and say,
he was either very smart or not smart at all. He's still
hedging his bet by keeping 40 million stake.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I hope he's wrong.
</TURN>
<TURN>
me, too. The question, I'm an AOL shareholder sitting at
home, hearing this news, done this set off a few alarms?
Will people panic and everybody sell it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
I think the stock will be weaker today. Again, you know,
the stock has drifted below $10. It's been in the
neighborhood for a while. I done see the thing going down a
lot. Interesting point here also, people are suggesting he
may be raising this money to buy those Atlanta sports teams
that apparently are on the block.

<TURN>
the braves and thrashers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
you really think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
you know, I'm not sure. He loves -- apparently they're for
sale. We'll have to see about that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thank you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thank you. Let's check 4 with Jack now. The question of the
day, Bill Bennet?
</TURN>
<TURN>
I figure if Turner's smarter than I am, I'm selling my 80
shares.
</TURN>
<TURN>
80 of them.

$13 and change, out. Talking about Bill Bennet this morning
one of the country's leading Crusaders for morality author
of "Virtues" and admits he has a gambling problem. Me He
made the admission after Bennett lost up to $8 million in
casinos in the last decade. The articles say he won at
times that he had $200,000 lines of credit at several
laying casinos. Gambling, however, is not one of of of the
Vices Bennett thinks is undermining American culture. We
want to hear from viewers this morning. He does say he's
going to stop. News of Bill Bennet's gambling changed your
opinion of him? Many, many responses. Hypocrite would be a
word present in many e-mails. Hypocrite. Barbara, Bill
Bennet's Glam gambling loss changed my opinion. Linda write
his can do what he wants with his money. I thought he was
smarter than that. Lawrence in Missouri, after sitting in
front of my TV night after night, listening to him,
watching every perversion, Sin and evil known to man or
beast, being glamourized by sitcoms and TV talking heads,
imagine my shock in hearing that Bill Bennet being soundly
condemned for gambling, is this the beginning of a new
morality? Chad New York big deal. What have you done wrong
this morning? I ain't telling, Chad. David say my opinion
did not change because of the new news. I always thought
Bennett was a louse. am@cnn.com is the address. Unburden
yourself.

<TURN>
we'll talk more about it with Jeff Greenfield coming up.
