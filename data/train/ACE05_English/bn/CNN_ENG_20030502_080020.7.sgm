back to the scene in Orlando Florida. We were here moments ago where
the man in the green in the forefront of the screen there. The former
P.O.W. David Williams was speaking to the crowd rather emotionally and
now you see he is taking down the black and white P.O.W. flag. I wish
I could tell you which site this flag was hoisted in. We have the
pictures coming in from central Florida, news 13. This is that City
Hall in Orlando, now I'm being told. Quite an emotional scene this
morning. David Williams, one of the p.o.w.s whose face we got to know
in the coverage that we saw coming from Iraq. Other p.o.w.s from Iraq
after they were captured and released, that dramatic release that
Sunday morning when they were picked up by a squadron of Marines who
had wanted wandered in a town in Baghdad and were told where they were
being kept. Dramatic rescue and then a return home. Quite an emotional
experience and one of us can only imagine what it must have been like
to endure. As we said, quite an emotional moment in Orlando, Florida.
And you see Apache helicopter pilot and his wife Michelle who was
talking with us on the telephone the Sunday morning when the video
came in of the rescue of the p.o.w.s and she was able to tell us on
the telephone as we had those pictures up on air, she identified her
husband and life just got better and better for her after that. Moving
on now, in upstate New York Stock Exchange criminal charges have been
filed in last month's fraternity hazing death at Platsberg State
University of New York. 11 members had been charged with negligent
homicide for forcing 18-year-old Pledge Walter Dean Jenning to drink
an excessive amount of water. The fraternity also faces more than 150
charges for other hazing activities, as well.
