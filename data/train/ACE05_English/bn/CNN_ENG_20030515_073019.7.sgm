earlier we talk about a new book claiming that President John Kennedy
had an affair with a White House intern early 1960s. A Kennedy
biographer Robert Dallek came across the story while doing research.
The woman's name has remain a mystery. The 60-year-old tells the New
York Daily News and others DPA she is glad to have the weight she's
been carrying for 41 years now off her shoulders. She says she was 19
at the time, working in D.C. at the White House, 1962, 1963, she says
today the allegations about her affair are the truth. Right now she
lives on the upper east side, works at a Presbyterian Church, has two
married daughters and after the news is out, after carrying it for 41
years, she feels better about it. This news breaking just today.
Robert Dallek tried to do the research to track this woman down in the
book, it did not happen but now she has indeed come forward.
