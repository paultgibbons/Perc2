it's Wednesday, April 30, 2003. Hello from Washington. I'm
Wolf Blitzer reporting. We are following several major
developments right now. That was then, this is now, 20
years after meeting Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is back in the Iraqi capital with
victorious U.S. troops. And you're looking at a live
picture from the "USS Abraham Lincoln" on its way back from
war. From its flight deck President Bush will make a major
announcement to the American people tomorrow night on the
end of major combat in Iraq. Right now we're also waiting
to hear from the president at the White House. We'll bring
you his comments as soon as we get them and we'll get to
all of that shortly, but first. A move by the president
today designed to save children's lives and among his
guests in the Rose Garden, Elizabeth Smart. Here's CNN's
justice correspondent Kelli arena. She is joining us live.
