reporter: Jamie's husband Jack was deployed a couple of
weeks ago. She and her daughter Jordan often shuffle
through these pictures of him taken before he left. She has
no idea where her husband is now, but thanks to a little
help from a Delta flight attendant, she knew he got where
he was going.

reporter: along with the picture, the flight attendant
wrote a letter saying she was Prague for Jack's safe
return. The trip to Georgia was just the first leg. He got

the flight attendants, they say they'll never forget their
