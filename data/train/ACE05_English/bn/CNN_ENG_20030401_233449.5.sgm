an airport in Key West, Florida, today became the setting of what
appeared to be a desperate attempt to enter the U.S. by a Cuban
national. The man was arrested there after authorities say he hijacked
a Cuban plane using what was reported to be grenades, ordering the
pilots to fly to Florida. The hijacker got off the plane wearing a
jacket that said, America across the back. And a small child clinging
to his leg.
