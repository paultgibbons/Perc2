USAIRWAYS is flying its way out of bankruptcy. The company
which lost nearly $4 billion over the past two years has
cut its annual costs by nearly $2 billion. Most of that was
saved by cutting employee wages and benefits. The Dow is
down. You see there, just about almost 140 points. Nasdaq
down 20 and the S&amp;P is down, as well. So the markets are
continuing their negative trend from last week. We'll keep
our I on that. Coming up right here, next hour on live
from, terror tactics on the battlefield. Is it a taste of
more to come in Iraq? We'll talk with a terror expert about
that, and Iraqi deserters on the northern front. Ben
Wedeman has their story why they're no longer fighting for
Saddam Hussein and Don Shepperd is going to answer some of
your questions as he looks at the battle hot spots. Now
let's go back to Wolf Blitzer in Kuwait City for more
special coverage of the war in Iraq.
