we're coming up on 23 after the hour on what is shaping up
to be a busy day here. But a joyous day for 5,000 sailors
and Marines and friends and family in the San Diego,
California area because the giant U.S. carrier
constellation is now returning home from the war in Iraq.
Frank Buckley is in San Diego and joins us now with the
latest scenes from there and the live pictures. Hi, Frank.

reporter: Leon, yet another day of incredible home coming.
This time the "USS Constellation" coming up. They're coming
home for the last time to San Diego. It's scheduled for
decommissioning in August. Let me give you a sense of the
excitement among families. Look at these folks who have not
seen their family members for seven months as the
Constellation was over in the Persian Gulf. Let me take you
up top to give you a larger view of how many folks are here
at Lima Pier. We are expecting some 15,000 people to greet
the "USS Constellation" as it comes home. Among the people
that will be here to greet those folks, there are always
the first-kissers, the people who win the first-kiss
lottery and the new dads. We will talk to one of the
winners of the first kiss contest. This is Tammy, your
husband is David. We have little Alisa here. She is 4 years
old told. Congratulations.
