seven former p.o.w.s are getting one step closer to home. They'll be
arriving at Ramstein Air Base in Germany a few hours from now. Once
doctors there say they are good to go, the seven will head stateside.
Doctors in Kuwait have already said the six men and one woman are in
good shape, so they may not have to stay in Germany very long. The
former p.o.w.s were rescued Sunday about 75 miles north of Baghdad.
They've been sticking close together ever since. Medical officers say
they became a team while in captivity and want to stay together as a
team until it's time to go to their separate homes.
