good evening, everyone. Tonight, the Middle East peace process is in
danger of being swept away by violence. President Bush called upon the
world to stop terrorism after a suicide bomb attack on a bus in
Jerusalem today. 16 people were killed. At least 70 were injured.
Shortly afterward, Israel killed seven people in Gaza, two of them
members of Hamas. Mike Hanna in Jerusalem, but first, going to Kelly
Wallace in KBA SDA where there's more helicopter attacks tonight.
Kelly?
