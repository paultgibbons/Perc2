a live picture of the President United States landing at an air field
in Northern Ireland. Once he gets out of the helicopter he'll transfer
to air force one to come home after a 20-hour visit with the Prime
Minister of Great Britain. They talked about a lot of things, about
what peace in the Middle East could look like, what post-war Iraq
could look like. They talked about problems in Northern Ireland. We're
going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off
this chopper. As you probably know, the Prime Minister of the Great
Britain has been under great pressure at home and much of Europe to
support giving the United Nations a very strong role in stabilizing
Iraq. The White House had signaled consistently it wants the United
States and Great Britain to create a lead role. We learned from John
King, traveling with the president, that the new Iraq run neither by
U.S./British coalition or United Nations, but by the Iraqi people.
That some of what the prime minister and president shared with
reporters at news conference following their meetings. The president
went on to say that an interim authority composed of Iraq grs inside
and outside the country will run Iraq until a permanent government can
be established. Do you want to hang with the shot? Okay, we're going
to stay with this shot. We'll talk more about what the two leaders
discussed at the joint news conference following their series of
meetings. They really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about
what the U.N. involvement might be to not worry. They said there will
definitely be some kind of role for the United Nations, they think
it's very important for the European nations to be on board with the
plan, but once again, they very much view the future of Iraq as being
that in Iraqi hands. The president greeting a number of dignitaries as
he gets ready here to board Air Force One on his way home. A little
earlier this morning, I spoke with an Iraqi dissident who teaches at
writes extensively on the Middle East. He wrote a book called the
Republic of fear. The politics of modern Iraq. And I asked him about
the news that Saddam Hussein was targeted in yesterday's strike and
how Iraqis would react if Saddam was killed.
