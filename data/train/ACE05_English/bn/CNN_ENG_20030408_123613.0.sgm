* * Hamburg, Germany. Central Command says the Iraqis shot down an
a-10 tank killer today. Officials report that the plane was apparently
down with a surface to air missile. It happened near the Baghdad
airport which is in U.S. hands. Pilot said they're doing well. All
right. U.S. marines entered southeastern Baghdad today and found
dozens of chemical suits masks and atropine injecters. They found it
at an industrial complex. Material has been haiftly abandon. The Iraqi
government reports 1252 civilians have been killed in the war. These
figures come to us from Abu Dhabi television. They cannot be verified
by CNN. The Iraqi government has not released the information or
military casualties at all. Now back to Wolf Blitzer and our
continuing coverage of the war in Iraq.
