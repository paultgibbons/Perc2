it looks like an annual tradition is building. 80,000
people with a shared love of music converge on a Tennessee
pasture for three days of good vibes and who knows what
else. It's called Bonnaroo. Check it out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
Bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole
jam band community is turned in.
</TURN>
<TURN>
that's what I really like about the jam community. It's
acceptance of improvizational music, DPES pit whatever
region or Gen re. It's about the freedom of the music and
the freedom of expression.
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, we sold all 80,000 tickets through our web site. We
sold out in 16 days. I mean, the amazing thing is, we used
no traditional advertising.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we put all these bands together. It draws a huge audience.
So the record companies and the music business has to take
all of these forms of music more seriously. It's like
strength in numbers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
I hope this kind of thing can happen in America, instead of
it just being these isolated festivals like Bonnaroo, it
really can happen in 100 cities every summer, like the
festivals do in Europe.
</TURN>
<TURN>
my only complaint is the overlapping. You know, as a music
lover that I am, there's five acts all playing at the same
time on five different stages that I want to see.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it really comes from the actual bands and the fact that
there's this grassroots following that's been there, you
know, for a long time. Primarily started by the grateful
dead, at least the future by the grateful dead. We will
get0 by we will survive
</TURN>
<TURN>
we're carrying on a tradition that started a long time. In
American music, improvization is what it's always been
arped.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it's not just clapping and having a good time. It makes you
feel a certain kind of love, and hopefully, that translates
in the community. You go out, you hug someone. You do
something good. You make a better world. For me, that's
music.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we love you. We
