a former FBI informant accused of being a double agent has been
indicted. The Charges Against Katrina Leung are the latest in an
alleged case of sex, spies, and international intrigue. Charles
Feldman is in Los Angeles with details on this one.

reporter: This is a story that has made the FBI look -- well, kind of
dopey. It has put a spotlight on U.S./China relations. Like any good
spy movie, it's already had a sequel with the first indictment earlier
in the week and another one just yesterday. On Thursday, the other
shoe dropped. Just one day after a former FBI counterintelligence
agent was indicted on charges of gross negligence, his mistress of two
decades, Katrina Leung, was herself indicted on more serious charges
of copying and possessing documents relating to the national security
of the United States. Documents she allegedly lifted on many occasions
from the briefcase of her ex-fbi Handler, James Smith. Leung's lawyers
wasted little time responding to the grand jury indictment.

Katrina Leung is no Matt Aharry, as people have suggested. She was
recruited actively by the FBI because of what she could do and because
of what she knew. She D not go out to get this job.

reporter: Leung, a prominent chinese-american, was practically the
toast of L.A. she was seemingly present for just about every event
involving local politicians, sometimes national ones, and various
high-ranking officials of the Chinese government. That part, at least,
was by design. Leung was hired by the FBI and paid almost $2 million
over 20 years to spy on the Chinese. Federal prosecutors now say she
pulled a fast one and actually spied on the U.S. for the Chinese. This
case is a major embarrassment
