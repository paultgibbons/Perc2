if you're just starting your week, good morning, once again. 7:30 up
and down the east coast. Welcome back to "American morning." OVERCAES
-- overseas, President Bush will leave France in a few hour's time
after a second meeting face-to-face in private with French President
Jacque Chirac today. The president called that meeting helpful and
said the disagreement between the United States and France over Iraq
does not mean the two countries have to be disagreeable. Mr. Bush
travels next to Egypt and he will enter Middle East peace talks at
Middle East. He says he will spend as much time as necessary to
achieve peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. A key trip
continues for the week. Want to say hello again to Daryn right?
