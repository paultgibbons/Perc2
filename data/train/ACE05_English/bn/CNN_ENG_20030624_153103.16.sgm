we're told the Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted by Prince
Charles as he arrived in London today. The music beginning as they
enter. Part of the formalities of a royal reception such as this. His
private plane arrived at Heathrow Airport. Putin and his wife left for
the official reception that you're seeing now here in central London.
We'll bring Walter Rodgers back in who's live outside Buckingham
Palace. Let's listen in for a few moments, Roger, and then we'll talk
about this reception and what it means. Listening to "God saved the
Queen." Her Majesty with Russian President, his wife and also Prince
Charles sitting down with their guests. Also with them Prime Minister
Tony Blair. Walter Rodgers outside of Buckingham Palace as the royal
reception here begins. First Time for Russian head of state to visit
Britain. More than 130 years, actually the last time was Alexander II
in 1874. Same type of Fan Fare and pomp to take place. Walter Rodgers,
let's talk about if we could, the guest list. Just looking at this
group at this royal reception and, I'm even noticing some gentleman,
probably a political and religious mix of sorts. How did the Queen
Design the guest list for this incredible and historic event?
