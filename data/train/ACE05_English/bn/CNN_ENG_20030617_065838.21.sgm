fishermen rescued near Vancouver by a Royal Caribbean
cruise ship. The men held on the sinking vessel until the
passenger ship was able to reach them. A cruise line
spokesman said if it were not for the fisherman's
protective suits, they probably would not have stayed warm
enough to survive. The same part of the world in which we
had that other incident the other day, about 52 degrees
that water temp. That is chilly. That's a job, Huh? Here is

worst job you ever snad high-profile people who are taking
it on the Arthur and heading for other places. The lady at
the Pentagon saying she was leaving, saying it had been an
honor serving her post but she's leaving for personal
reasons. Frank Keating leaving a commission set up to look
into allegations of sex abuse in the Catholic Church, he
decided to quit after he made comments comparing
uncooperative church bishops to La Cosa Nosta, other folks,
Ari Fleischer. We thought it might be interesting to share
tales of the worst job you ever had. Why did you leave it?
You can e-mail us -- this done count, sorry. Crews all
going, this one right here?
