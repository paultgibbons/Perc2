it's with Wednesday, March 5 200 3. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. Is
the U.S. going to war? If you listen to the from's men it sounds like
the battle is about to begin, maybe only days from now. America's top
diplomat laid out the case for war. Secretary of State Colin Powell
acted like a prosecutor, pointing out Iraq's failures. Over at the
Pentagon, the military leaders say that troops are ready to fight
right now even as they await word of the president's order, but there
is major opposition today, France, Germany and Russia plan a showdown
at theupups in a bid to stop the U.S.'s war machine and their voices
of dissent echoed by protestors from Australia to Egypt to university
students right here in the United States. Even the Vatican voiced
concerns today. Later this hour I'll speak exclusively to Cardinal Pio
Laghi, the man dismatched by Pope John Paul II to persuade President
Bush to avoid war, but we begin with reports from the United Nations,
the Pentagon and the White House. First to Chris Burns with news on
the president and the Secretary of state who switched from diplomacy
to talk of war. Chris?
