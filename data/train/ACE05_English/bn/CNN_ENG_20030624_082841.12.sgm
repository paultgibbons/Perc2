okay. Question of the day. Here's Jack back with that.

thank you, Bill. There's a new poll out this morning, ABC News
Washington Post poll that suggests that most Americans would support
U.S. military action against Iran in order to keep the country from
acquiring nuclear weapons. According to the survey, 56% said they
would back military force block Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
38% said they'd oppose it. That was the question this morning. Would
you support the use of military force to block Iran from developing
nuclear weapons? We have gotten hundred of responses beginning this
one from Edward in Oklahoma. I support the use of military force 100%.
The problem is with all of the American forces bizy in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Korea, the Balkans, the Philippines and Korea, can we be
sure that France and Russia are up to the job? Not Bad. Sally in
Daytona Beach. I think if we're going to get this terror thing
overwith, I think we need to clear the countries that house them. It
would be deadly to let Iran let their hands on nuclear weapons employ
I would support any action.

United Nations? Kay Jones in Waterford, Connecticut, sure, let's
invade Iran. Wior already over there, besides the biggest cost us to
next to the loss of life is transporting our troops overseas. Iraq,
Iran. It's only one letter off, we could call it a typo. A little
cruel. Bill in Montana. Nuclear Weapons in Iran, hope -- and Buzz
writes no one wants to see a war, but no one upons to see another
September 11th even more. Especially a nuclear September 11th. I would
support military action in Iran if it helps to stabilize that area of
the world.
