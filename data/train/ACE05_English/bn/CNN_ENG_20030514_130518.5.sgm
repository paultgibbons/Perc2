a bomb exploded today in a courtroom in southern Yemen, injuring four
people, one of them a judge. A man with a pistol was arrested outside
of the courthouse and police say he admits planning the bombs. It was
the same courtroom where a suspected al Qaeda militant got a death
sentence last week for killing three American missionaries.
