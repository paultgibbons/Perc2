no one seems to be sure what's happened to Saddam Hussein
and his two sons, but one thing is becoming more clear --
Uday and Qusay were just as bad as their father if not
worse. "Time" Magazine's Michael Weisskopf has uncovered
some stunning details about the lives of these two. He
joins US now from Washington. Thanks for taking the time to
join us. Michael, as I read the article, we knew that these
were not good guys, putting it mildly, but as you saw and
heard the revelations, what were your reactions? They're
stomach turning, to put it bluntly.

the extent of the depravity was truly0stunning, you're
right and they took different paths, these two guys. The
younger of the two brothers, Qusay was a very ic
professional killer who pulled the trigger with political

about as bad as it got with these guys? I guess it can't
get much worse.

I thought that the depth may be how he treated his friends,
% and there are a couple of stories we heard about how he
forced friends to drink large quantities of grain alcohol
until they vomited. Also one friend he was afraid was going
to leave the country and spill the beans on him. He had him
arrested by his Fedayeen Saddam. He had him held down, Tong
pulled out by pliers and sliced off with a scapel.

awful. People still fear them and Saddam Hussein himself.
How did you get people to talk? Were they forthcoming or
pretty reticent about talking about these guys?
</TURN>
<TURN>
it was a hard report. It was hard to find people, and then
hard to get them to talk. Over time, we gained trust. We
promised to hold on to people's anonimity if we could.
After a little while, after we primed the pump, the people
wanted to
