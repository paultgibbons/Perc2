by U.S. forces and which appears to be run by members of the the war
began in Iraq several weeks ago. The operation as it continues in the
north continues to be a situation of unrest. The area around Mosul
described as uncertain in terms of its stability with deliberate
agitation. Those are the words there that General Brooks used a short
time ago. The unrest continues there and this follows up the shooting
we talked about yesterday in which at least seven Iraqis were killed
by U.S. fire after they apparently came under fire trying to secure a
certain part of the central part of Mosul. Also, news about another
half-broth of Saddam Hussein apparently now apprehended overnight in
Baghdad with the I assistance of local Iraqis. Not sure where in
Baghdad, personal the person Western neighborhood of Mansour. You
might remember last week when another half-brother of Saddam Hussein
was picked up trying to cross into Syria and that time, we have been
told Syria has closed its border with Iraq to prevent any of that
ongoing. We'll go through all of this throughout the morning here.
First, to the Pentagon and Barbara Starr to pick up what's happening.
