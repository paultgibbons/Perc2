year. Profits for the end of the year did see profit as
well. Motorola and Texas instruments both in the chips base

Finally Amr, the stock gained 15% yesterday, today's shares
up another Sen.8%. The flight attendants have until 6:00
today to ratify labor concessions. The pilots union and
ground crew did so yesterday. The flight attendants came in
with a close vote rejecting these concessions so the CEO

agreements, Amr will have to file for bankruptcy. Investors
are betting they will agree, 16.8% to the upside is
