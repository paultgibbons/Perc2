6:03 a.m. eastern time, seven Americans who had been prisoners of war
in Iraq make a public appearance at the Medical Center in Germany.
They say they're looking forward to going home, which relatives of one
former p.o.w. say could happen as soon as tomorrow. Officials at the
hospital say the Sev reason in good shape and their prognosis is
excellent, even though three have gunshot wounds. 6:21 eastern time,
2:21 p.m. in Iraq, Iraqi protesters demonstrate outside a Baghdad
mosque, opposing what they call the U.S. occupation, and saying any
new Iraqi government must represent the people. 6:33 a.m., CNN's Jane
Arraf report from Kirkuk that local authorities and U.S. investigators
are still mystified by a graveyard on a military base abandoned by the
old Iraqi regime. There are hundreds of unmarked graves, apparently
dating back to the 1991 Gulf War, or before. But it's not clear
whether the people buried there are victims of regime atrocities, or
whether it's simply a military graveyard. 7:05 a.m., U.S. Central
Command says another top Baath Party official has been captured. He
was handed over to coalition special forces by Iraqi Kurds last night.
8:10 a.m., Abu Dhabi TV broadcasts videotape which it says shows
Saddam Hussein in a Baghdad neighborhood last Wednesday, April 9th,
the day the city fell to coalition troops. The network has not said
where it got the tape. There's no way to confirm when it was shot or
whether the man in the video is really Saddam Hussein.
