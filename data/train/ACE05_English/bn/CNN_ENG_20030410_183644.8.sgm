until southern Iraq, another symbol of Saddam Hussein's regime is in
ruins tonight. Saddam Hussein's private yacht and quite a yacht it is
or was. It was hit by coalition bombs and missiles and then burned and
looted by Iraqis. The boat was one of the world's most luxurious
yachts when it was launched some 20 years ago. Now the scorched hulk
floats aimlessly in the Arab waterway next to Basra's dock yards.
People in Baghdad celebrate the fall of a leader whose fate is unknown
tonight. We'll be talking with an expert on Saddam Hussein, author
Andrew Coburn about whether Saddam Hussein is dead or alive and where
in the world is he. Also, the long journey of the marine who covered
the statue of Saddam Hussein with an American flag. Bill Tucker will
have a special report on the life of Marine Corporal Edward Chin. And
actress Jane Fonda is now questioning freedom of the United States.
And she has a few thoughts about ignorance. So do we. Stay with us.
