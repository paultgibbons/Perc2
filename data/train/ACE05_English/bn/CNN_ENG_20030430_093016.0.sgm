senators and a good teacher believes in the possibilities of every boy
and girl. The good teacher sees what is possible. A good teacher
believes in the responsibility of every school to bring out the best
in every student. And 2001, we passed what's called the no child left
behind legislation. I Love Tha phrase, because it's a commitment of
our nation to make sure that not only does every child excel, but no
child gets left behind. Members of both parties, both Republicans and
Democrats came together to pass this law inherent in the law is the
vision of high standards. And money to meet the standards. An historic
reforms. All of which put the education decisions of America in the
hands of teachers and principals and local officials. But we also said
that as we seek excellence for every child, we must design
accountability systems at the state level to determine whether or not
each child is learning. In order to make sure no child gets left
behind, we must understand whether or not each child is learning to
read and write and add and subtract. If there are, there will be
plenty of praise. If not, we will work to design programs to make sure
no child gets left behind. That's the crux of the law. Every state met
the laws January 31st deadline for submitting their accountability
plans for approval. I'm pleased to announce that secretary page has
approved plans from Arkansas, Missouri and Washington State. which
bring the -- which bring the total number of approved plans to 16
covering 16 million children in public schools across America.
Secretary Page and his department will continue working with the rest
of the states to get the plans approved as quickly as possible. People
are responding to the challenge at the local level. People are
beginning to develop the accountability systems to show your states
and your communities that you're doing your job. Leaving no doubt in
the minds of the parents and taxpayers and citizens, some of whom
praise public schools, some are critical of public schools, that
you're performing. They will understand why you're here being honored
in Washington, D.C. as one of the top 54 teachers around our country.
Education reform depends on good laws and good plans but you and I
know it ultimately depends on good teachers. Last June states
submitted to the Department of Education Strategies for ensuring that
all teachers are highly qualified. By this September, states will
assess the programs they expect to make by 2005 and 2006 school year.
The Department is working with states to help teachers meet new
definitions of teacher quality, so that every classroom will have a
well-trained highly effective teacher like you all. Our 2003 national
teacher of the year is an example of the highest professional
standards. And the finest personal qualities. Betsy Rogers teaches
first and second grade students and leads Alabama. She is an
accomplished teacher with 22 years in the profession. She could have
her pick of any school. Yet she chooses to teach in the school in an
underprivileged rural area because she believes that devoted teachers
and principals can make a difference in the lives of students from
every background. Teaching is a tradition in Betsy's family. Her
grandmother was a teacher. Her mother taught Sunday School for 50
years. And her own career Betsy Rogers is known for a commitment to
students that goes beyond school hours. She gives before school
tutoring to students who need extra help learning to read. And
volunteers on school committees after hours. She attends sporting
events and birthday parties for her students. She helps the familiar
list of disadvantaged students through local church and community
groups. Betsy also encourages her students to help each other no
matter what your circumstances in life, you can always give. Teachers
like Betsy Rogers put children on the road to becoming good citizens.
As importantly, successful adults. They show students that there are a
lot of caring people ready to help along the way. I thank every one of
our teachers of the year for your determination and your love. Each of
you is an example of excellence in the classroom. Each of you is a
model for a young teacher to follow. And your students are fortunate
to have talented and good-hearted people in their lives. And our
nation is fortunate to have you in the classroom. Thank you for your
work. May God bless what you do. And now I'm pleased to introduce the
national teacher of the year Betsy Rogers. [ applause ]
