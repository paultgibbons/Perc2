it is 11:00 a.m. on the East Coast. From the CNN center in Atlanta,
I'm Fred Fred. A first here on "CNN live today," a spiraling cycle of
violence threatening the latest Middle East peace efforts. This
morning Hamas vows revenge for an Israeli missile attack. Israeli
hospital gun ships fired on a jeep in Gaza. The strike targeted a
Hamas leader. And two other people were killed including a mother and
bodyguard. Mike Hanna is tracking the latest developments from there.
He joins us live with the details. Mike?
