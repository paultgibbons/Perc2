we're getting breaking news to us, from Jerusalem. We understand there
has been an explosion there. This right now, again, following up in
the last few days of violent activity we've seen in the wake of what
was widely perceived to be as progress in the peace process. We
understand that a bus has been -- exploded. We are hearing it happened
indown town Jerusalem. Do we have Mike Hanna available? Trying to get
Mike Hanna or Jerusalem bureau chief, who was just on the air with us
a matter of minutes ago. With the latest update on what was happening
there and it appears in the time since we've talked to Mike and also
talked to professor about the peace process, evidence again that the
resistance to any progress does continue. We are now hearing once
again, this coming to us off Associated Press wires there was an
explosion there and we understand that several people have been
killed. Again, this is what we're getting from the Associated Press.
We're trying to get ahold of our reporters in Jerusalem to give us the
latest. And this being the latest in a series of what has become an
almost customary tit for tat exchange of violent activity. Last week,
if you may recall, there was a strike on afraid in which a number of
Israeli soldiers killed, that executed by coordinated group of Islamic
Jihad as well as al AK satisfy martyr brigades, and Hamas all claiming
responsibility for that and the strike ordered by Sharon against the
Palestinian leadership going, targeting a top leader, Mr. Rantissi who
escaped the helicopter rocket attack on his motorcade. However, two
others who were there did die. This now, this happened over the
weekend and then this morning,ware hearing it appear as though perhaps
there has been another retaler to strike of some kind. We can't con
foirm that is what happened. All we can tell you, there was an
explosion on a bus in Jerusalem in ventral -- Central Jerusalem. A
number of people killed, perhaps several people being killed in the
explosion, which happened just moments ago. Once again, we're trying
to get ahold of our Mike Hanna, who was just with us on the phone. I
believe Mike is over in Jerusalem in the bureau working the
telephones, trying to get as much information as he can and once behe
gets something we'll deliver it to you. We'll take a break and when we
come back, we'll pick up coverage of this development in Jerusalem
with Mike Hanna. How's that new analyst doing? He's really hit the
ground running. Even the traders are complimenting him. [crash]
interesting stock presentation this morning. [whoosh] when you manage
the kind of money we do, you tend to be a little more demanding.
Evergreen. Investments that stand the test of time.
