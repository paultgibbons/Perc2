as Bob pointed out, the next battle ground is a bill to
block lawsuits by victims of gun violence or families
against gunmakers and dealers. And one person whose suit
would be blocked is Denise Johnson if the legislation goes
through, the widow of bus driver Conrad Johnson, the last
person killed in the Washington, D.C. sniper attacks.
Jonathan Lowe is an attorney with the Brady Center to
prevent gun violence who filed the suit on behalf of
Johnson and other victims' families. Good of you to join
us. Let's talk about what Ms. Johnson wrote in the
"Washington Post" today. We'll put a small part of that up
on the screen right now where she said, "I am confident
that the criminal justice system will work to punish the
people who killed my husband. But the civil justice system
must also be allowed to work. Those who share
responsibility for my husband's death must also be held
accountable." What does she mean?
