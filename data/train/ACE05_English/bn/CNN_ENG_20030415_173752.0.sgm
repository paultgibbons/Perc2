spy to help Free Private Jessica Lynch. * * Lara hijacking
in 1995 has been captured by U.S. forces in or near
Baghdad. This was the Italian ship that was taken -- that
was captured by Palestinian terrorists back in 1985 and
some may remember the story of Leon clinghover, he was in a
cheal chair and the terrorists shot him and pushed him over
the side of the ship into the Mediterranean where he
obviously, died. This man, Abu Abbas has lived an I tin
rant life, he's been in Tunas. He's been in Libya and he's
been living under the protection of Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad, but he is wanted for murder in Italy Italy. There
are charges, U.S. charges which have expired but could, I
am told, possibly be re -- restarted for piracy, hostage
taking and conspiracy. So this is one of the oldest cases
of terrorism that is one of the oldest cases that has not
been closed to date T. now look as if this man Abu Absaas
in U.S. hands. Miles?
