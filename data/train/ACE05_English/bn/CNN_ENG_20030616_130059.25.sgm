reports showing a rebound in New York's manufacturing
sector is helping to fuel that optimism today. Right now
the Dow Jones industrial average with a triple-digit gain,
up 137. The blue chip advance is being led by manufacturers
3m and Caterpillar, as well as Merck and Johnson & Johnson.
And the Nasdaq composite is adding more than 1.5%.
Meantime, shares of Kmart are surging nearly $3. It lost
$862 million in the first quarter, but that's much better

bankruptcy protection. That's the very latest from Wall
