  CNNHL_ENG_20030625_193346.7   NEWS STORY   2003-06-25 19:39:30     CNN has learned Osama bin Laden sent a private letter to his followers in February, ordering them to attack the U.S. and its allies. A month later, U.S. and Pakistani troops zeroed in on bin Laden's location, but he escaped. Intelligence sources in Asia say the message was taken by couriers from an area along the Pakistan/afghanistan border, where Bin Laden is believed to be hiding. The message was spread to Al Qaeda members in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.     2003-06-25 19:39:48
