  CNNHL_ENG_20030618_230303.36   NEWS STORY   2003-06-18 23:32:01     it looks like an annual tradition is building. 80,000 people with a shared love of music converge on a Tennessee pasture for three days of good vibes and who knows what else. It's called Bonnaroo. Check it out.   Bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in.   that's what I really like about the jam community.

For me, that's music.   we love you. We     2003-06-18 23:34:18
