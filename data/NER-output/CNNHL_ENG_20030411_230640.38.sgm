  CNNHL_ENG_20030411_230640.38   NEWS STORY   2003-04-11 23:25:18     Sharon Osbourne did not enjoy her meal at a Los Angeles restaurant last night. Ozzy's wife reportedly got into a fight with Hollywood agent Renee Tab. Sharon spit on Tab and called her names. Osbourne's spokeswomen says Sharon was quote, "viciously assaulted and treated at a hospital." Disagreement between the women began months ago when Osbourne said Tab atended her family's New Year's Eve party uninvited and then won the door prize, a $15,000 necklace. A spokesman says that if any charges are filed, they will be on the low end of the misdemeanor scale.     2003-04-11 23:25:46
